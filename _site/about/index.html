  <h1>About</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>The purpose to create this blog was to give me a reason to write more and reduce the time procrastinating through YouTube or mindlessly navigating through the Web trying to find something of interest, in the end spending countless hours of useless web surfing without learning anything meaningful. I hope that owning this blog will force me to sit down to write ideas and actually get to spend more time structuring content around a subject that has interested me for nearly ten years at the time of this writing.</p>

<p>Now that the reason is out of the way, and being it a little bit selfish, I’ll state that there’s a more altruistic reason behind the thematic choice for the blog. The main thematic of this blog is Antennas. There are several websites dedicated to it and there’s countless of academic books around the subject. Therefore, this page is not going to be about the theory of antennas, or to show the basic concepts around the antenna subject in an academic way as you often find in the internet. Even though I might post some equations here and there and even make a few posts about theory, for consistency and completeness sake, that’s not the main point, for that there’s already several, YouTube and Web, pages, here I’ll post a more personal view about antennas.</p>

<p>I’ve been studying antennas for nearly ten years. I’m an electronics engineer by trade, but antennas has always been my niche topic of interest in the area. I really don’t know any special reason for it, but I always felt attracted to the concepts around this strange objects, which are enablers for some of the most interesting technologies we have today. After all, if you think wireless then there’s an antenna!</p>

<p>I also fizzle around with embedded circuits and other RF electronics, so I might post some stuff about those projects and ideas to. If you find the content of this blog interesting, feel free to send me a message. If that message is requesting help to try to solve your school homework, then don’t expect an answer (although that might happen if I find myself generous in that particular day). Even though my work somehow deals with antennas, I don’t work as an antenna engineer, I don’t develop/design antennas as my day-by-day trade, even though I help to solve and optimize a lot of stuff about RF systems in my daily job. Therefore, what you can find here is essentially posts about commonly used antennas, and antennas that I found in scientific papers and decided to simulate them. I do that for a hobby, so I decided to make a blog, to post those results and have a decent and structured (as best as I can manage) place to document those findings.</p>
