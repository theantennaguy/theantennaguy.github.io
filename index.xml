      <description>The purpose to create this blog was to give me a reason to write more and reduce the time procrastinating through YouTube or mindlessly navigating through the Web trying to find something of interest, in the end spending countless hours of useless web surfing without learning anything meaningful. I hope that owning this blog will force me to sit down to write ideas and actually get to spend more time structuring content around a subject that has interested me for nearly ten years at the time of this writing.</description>

      <description>On most of the posts you&amp;rsquo;ll find in this blog, I used CST Microwave Studio for the simulations. I have been using this tool for more then eight years. I have access to a license through my company and I was authorized to use it for leisure not-for-profit purposes, so long I only use it during off-hours.
You can use any other software, a free alternative is openEMS and there are student licenses and some limited demonstration licenses for other similar softwares, like Sonnet for example.</description>

      <description>This is the first official entry to the blog!
{:refdef: style=&amp;ldquo;text-align: center;&amp;rdquo;} {: refdef}
So the other day I was watching this video and I thought &amp;ldquo;Hey I can actually do that!&amp;rdquo; (Design UHF RFID antenna tags). So I decided the first entries to this blog would be dedicated to UHF RFID antennas (I don&amp;rsquo;t even feel qualified to qualify that idea&amp;hellip;).
I always found RFID technology very interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame that it is really obscured, especially the UHF.</description>
