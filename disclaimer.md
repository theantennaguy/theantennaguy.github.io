On most of the posts you'll find in this blog, I used CST Microwave Studio for the simulations. I have been using this tool for more then eight years. I have access to a license through my company and I was authorized to use it for leisure not-for-profit purposes, so long I only use it during off-hours. 

You can use any other software, a free alternative is openEMS and there are student licenses and some limited demonstration licenses for other similar softwares, like Sonnet for example. If you can't afford expensive tools and the free tools are not able to simulate the antennas I show here on the blog, the good thing is that you can always build the antenna with the dimensions I give in the final design and you should have a working antenna for the given purpose in case you need one. 

If you need assistance with simulation, I may be able to provide it, if I have some spare time. If you need consulting service to help with an antenna design, I may be able to provide. However, please remember I'll not be able to use CST to conduct your design simulations, I am not allowed to do that. Therefore, only ask me help to design an antenna, if you have the tools to simulate it yourself.
