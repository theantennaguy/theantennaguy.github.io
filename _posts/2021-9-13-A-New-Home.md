I've been cooking the change from blogger to a GitHub pages for a while. My [blog](https://thatantennaguy.blogspot.com), as well as my small personal projects, have been stalled for more than half a year now. Honestly, I don't really know how to explain this absence and lack of time for anything. Somehow today I finally got the time and disposition to tackle this task and get back to do what should have been done quite a while ago. To setup my [personal page](https://theantennaguy.github.io) on GitHub pages and migrate the content of my blog to my github pages.

Stay tuned, I'll be making my next post hopefully during November... I hope!
